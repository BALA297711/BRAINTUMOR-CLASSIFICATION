# BRAINTUMOR-CLASSIFICATION
The project "Brain Tumor Identification" is used for identifying the different stages of tumors caused in the brain based on a collective of MRI scan images. Here, we use deep learning in python by observing a set of different images of tumors and use it to determine the stage of tumor caused in the brain. Especially in this work MRI images are used to diagnose tumors in the brain. However the huge amount of data generated by MRI scans thwarts manual classification of tumor vs non-tumor in a particular time. But it has some limitations (i.e) accurate quantitative measurements are provided for a limited number of images. Hence trusted and automatic classification schemes are essential to prevent the death rate of human.Hence the Brain tumor is classified using the convolutional Neural Networks.
It is mainly done using Convolutional neural networks and it is composed of various phases auch as data preprocessing which includes the brain images processing and It identifies whether it is tumor or based on the final outcomes and This project is employed in Jupyter notebook.
